- 👋 Hi, I’m @Uodvraxz
- 👀 I’m interested in building a website to host my maths ed content
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js
- 💞️ I’m a mathematician with a strong background in theoretical CS so can collaborate in projects that require problem solving and algorithm design. Not so good at actual coding.
